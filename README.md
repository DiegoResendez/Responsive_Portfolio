# Responsive_Portfolio
This project is the first step in development of my portfolio site.

Using Bootstrap components as well as sample images provided by class instructors, I created three webpages to showcase what we learned about Bootstrap.  Sample images can be found at (https://uwa.bootcampcontent.com/UWA-Bootcamp/uw-sea-fsf-pt-03-2020-u-c/tree/master/02-CSS-Bootstrap/02-Homework/Assets/Images)

The webpages had the following requirements:
A navbar
A responsive layout
Responsive images

What I learned:
During this project I was able to learn the use of Bootstrap as well as the manipulation of the components in html.  I also learned the process of responsive layout to style the pages for different screen sizes.  

What I changed:
I changed a few things from the samples, including my name, images and the colors used.  I used Lorem Ipsum text and placeholder images due to time constraints.  

Portfolio was built from scratch using https://getbootstrap.com/
